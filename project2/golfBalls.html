      <h3>The Diffrent Types of Golf Balls</h3>

      <p>
        For beginner golfers it is not that big of a deal to pick the correct
        right golf ball, however for pros and advanced golfers, picking the
        right golf ball is very critical. Golf balls have different number of
        layers and have compression ratings, some have more spin than others and
        some are much softer. Here are some of the different types of golf balls
        on the market.

      <h3>Tour Performance</h3>
      <p>
        <a id="tourPerformance"></a> Tour performance have 3-5 layers, these
        balls are usually the most expensive on the market, they are designed
        for optimal distance, feel and spin. To get the most benefit from this
        ball you will need a faster swing speed. <br /><a

      <h3>Tour value</h3>
      <p>
        <a id="Tourvalue"></a>
        Tour value have 3 layers and these balls are like tour performance, but
        they have a lower compression rating, less spin, and a cheaper price
        tag.

      <h3>Straight Distance</h3>
      <p>
        <a id="StraightDistance"></a> Straight distance has 2-3 layers, and
        these balls are built with a large core and thin outer layer which is
        optimal for maximum distance. However, these balls don’t have much
        short-game performance due to wedge spin. <br />

      <h3>Soft Distance</h3>
      <p>
        <a id="SoftDistance"></a>
        soft distance has 2-3 layers, and these balls have a low compression
        rating and are designed for people with slower swing speeds.

      <p>
        As you noticed each of the different balls on the market have a
        different number of layers. Golf balls have multiple layers because it
        allows players to get the optimal feel, distance, and backspin.
        Additional layers will help players with a faster swing speed get more
        spin with their wedges and less spin with their driver.
      </p>
