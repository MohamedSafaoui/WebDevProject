      <h3>Woods</h3>
      <p>
        <a id="woods"></a>
        The woods clubs consist of the driver and the fairway woods. Although
        they are called woods their clubheads are no longer made from wood. The
        reason to pick a club from the woods category would be because golfers
        are able to swing them the fastest and are used for long shots from the
        teeing ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are usually peoples favorite, not only becasue of the long range
        but, also how satisfying a perfect stike sounds.

      <h3>Irons</h3>
      <p>
        <a id="irons"></a>
        Irons come in numbered sets ranging from 3-iron to 9-iron. Irons have
        smaller clubheads than woods and are usually very thin. Irons are
        generally used on shots from the fairway. The lower the iron number the
        further the ball should travel
      </p>
      <h3>Hybrids</h3>
      <p>
        <a id="hybrids"></a>
        Hybrids are a newer category of golf clubs. Just like the name itself,
        it is a hybrid between the woods and the irons. Just like the irons they
        are numbered, and the number corresponds to the iron they replace.
      </p>
      <h3>Wedges</h3>
      <p>
        <a id="wedges"></a>
        The wedges category includes the pitching wedge, gap wedge, sand wedge
        and lob wedge. Wedges are their own type of golf club. Wedges are used
        for shorter shots into the greens, pitches around the green and are very
        helpful for playing out of sand traps.
      </p>
      <h3>Putters</h3>
      <p>
        <a id="putters"></a>
        Putters comes in the widest varieties of shapes and sizes. Putters are
        used for putting in the putting greens to make the ball into the hole.
